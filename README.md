# note-taker

## Description 

I wanted to create an application that enabled me to take notes and save them online to organize and keep track of my thoughts for the day. This was a challenging assignment for me and was the first time I experienced utilizing express and posting and getting API calls to create a dynamically updated application.

Future development for this project will include fixing up the UI to have a more appealing look and greater functionality. A simple start to this will be to make the text area larger and customize the colors.
